# AI-Enhanced HR Web Application - Proof of Concept (POC)
Description
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Proof of Concept (POC) of an AI-Enhanced HR Web Application. The project aims to explore and demonstrate the potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various aspects of Human Resources (HR) management, with a particular focus on recruitment and talent acquisition.

Project Overview
The AI-Enhanced HR Web Application is designed as a POC to showcase how AI can be leveraged to streamline HR processes, improve decision-making, and enhance the overall efficiency of HR operations. 
The key feature of this POC is the use of AI for automating and optimizing the recruitment process, including candidate screening, resume parsing, and matching candidates to job descriptions using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

Key Features
AI-Powered Candidate Screening: Automates the process of parsing and analyzing resumes, extracting key information such as skills, experience, and educational background.

Intelligent Job-Candidate Matching: Utilizes NLP to compare candidate profiles with job descriptions, identifying the best matches based on various criteria.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple yet effective web interface for HR professionals to manage job postings, upload resumes, and view AI-generated candidate recommendations.

Feedback Mechanism: Incorporates a system for HR professionals to provide feedback on the AI recommendations, facilitating continuous learning and improvement of the AI algorithms.

Technologies Used

Backend: Python with Flask/Django
AI and Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Goals of the POC
To evaluate the effectiveness of AI in enhancing HR recruitment processes.
To demonstrate the practicality and benefits of AI in handling large volumes of candidate data.
To gather insights and feedback for future development and scaling of the application.
Status and Contributions
This project is currently in the Proof of Concept stage and is open to contributions, suggestions, and feedback from the community. We are particularly interested in collaborations for further development, testing, and refinement of the AI algorithms and user interface.
